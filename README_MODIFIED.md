# use tf-faster-rcnn to do folder detection
This repository is based on the original [tf-faster-rcnn code](https://github.com/endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn). I  do some modifications so as to adapt the code to my file folder detection system.

### Requirements
**Note**: At first you should get the models and data set up as the README.MD shows.
